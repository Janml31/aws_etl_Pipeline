# Problem Statement: Dynamic Sampling and Column Validation for ETL Pipeline
You are tasked with enhancing an existing ETL pipeline that processes Parquet files containing business data. The goal is to collect a dynamic sample from the data and validate the columns marked as empty in the sample against the original data. If any column in the sample contains data in the original data, append the corresponding rows to the sample.

# Existing Code Overview:
The existing code processes Parquet files stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. It uses PySpark to perform the ETL operations. The following are the main steps of the existing code:

Initialize the Spark context and session.
Define the S3 bucket and prefix to access the Parquet files.
List the Parquet files in the specified S3 prefix.
Define a function to identify empty columns in a DataFrame.
Iterate through the Parquet files:
    a. Read the Parquet file into a DataFrame.
    b. Collect a random sample from the DataFrame.
    c. Identify empty columns in the sample.
    d. If empty columns are found:
    - Filter non-empty rows in the original data based on the empty columns in the sample.
    - Append the non-empty rows to the sample DataFrame.
e. Save the sample as a CSV file in the output location.
# Enhanced Solution:
The enhancement to the existing code focuses on dynamically identifying columns with data in the original data based on the columns marked as empty in the sample. If any of these columns have data in the original data, the corresponding rows are appended to the sample.

# To achieve this enhancement

The code first collects a dynamic sample from the data as before.
    It identifies empty columns in the sample and checks for their presence in the original data.
    For each empty column in the sample:
    The original data is filtered to retrieve non-empty rows in that column.
    These non-empty rows are appended to the sample DataFrame.
    The enhanced code ensures that the sample includes rows with non-empty values in columns that were originally identified as empty in the sample.
# Conclusion:
By enhancing the ETL pipeline with dynamic sampling and column validation, the code ensures that the collected sample contains rows with relevant data. This approach improves the sample's representativeness while maintaining data integrity for downstream analysis
